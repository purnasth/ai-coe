# Vyaguta Pulse

Vyaguta Pulse flow starts with the creation of Pulse profile after an individual is onboarded to their respective Area within Leapfrog. Usually, this happens shortly after someone joins Leapfrog.

A Pulse profile accumulates the timeline of a Leapfrogger’s journey and growth at Leapfrog.

## Parties Involved in Pulse

- **POps:** People Management Team (People Operations and People Development Team) that facilitates and coordinates to ensure that the process is being executed smoothly
- **Appraisee:** Individual Leapfroggers whose Pulse journey is being created
- **Appraiser/Co-appraiser:** A person who has worked closely with the Appraisee and is skilled to evaluate the Appraisee. E.g. Supervisor, Senior Members, Team Manager, Project Manager, Team Leader etc.
- **Team Manager:** Managers from the Appraisee’s respective areas like Development, QA, PM, Design…
- **Leapfroggers:** Other individuals apart from those mentioned above who will be playing the role of peers/team members/colleagues/coworker during peer feedback
- **Project Leader:** Individuals who nominate team members under various performance categories, such as Exceeds Expectations, Meets Expectations, and Below Expectations, based on the assessments of their team's performance and potential to grow
- **Spearheads:** Senior leaders who play a crucial role in the Pulse flow, finalizing promotions and determining performance ratings in AEPA

## Main Elements of Pulse Flow

- **Expectation Setting** (Set by Appraiser and Appraisee)
- **Self-reflection** (Logged by Appraisee)
- **Feedback**
- **Promotion/Performance Improvement Plan**
- **Ask for Help**
- **Pulse Walkthrough**

### Expectation Setting

Expectations are the list of action items/goals which are set by the respective Appraiser (for their Appraisee). An Appraisee can set a separate list of expectations for self as well. Expectations can be set and revised:

- At the beginning of each quarter of the calendar year (this cycle repeats in every 3 months).
- At the time of project allocation/team allocation.
- At the time of project transfer.

### Self-reflection

Self-reflections are the lists of achievements/updates/tasks that the Appraisees write in their Pulse profile:

- At any point within the quarter as soon as the Appraisees have concrete updates about progress to share.
- At the end of the project.
- At the time of project transfer.

### Feedback

Feedback on the Appraisee's achievements/updates/tasks are given by the Appraiser based on which Appraisee will write their replies/comments and the conversation continues. Feedback can be given:

- At any point during the quarter as soon as the Appraiser has a concrete and constructive feedback to share.
- At the end of the project.
- At the time of project transfer.

### Promotion/Performance Improvement Plan

After expectations setting, and the self-reflection and feedback conversation, the Appraiser verifies an appropriate time for the Appraisee to be:

- Eligible for Promotion
- Enroll in a Performance Improvement Plan for better observation

### Ask for Help

Appraisees can request for support from their Appraisers whenever they need help to meet set expectations.

### Pulse Walkthrough

Our goal is to have more feedback loops between an Appraisee and an Appraiser for continuous assessment. However, Pulse, our new feedback system targets to have this cycle complete at least once every quarter.

## Frequently Asked Questions (Pulse)

### What is Vyaguta Pulse?

A feedback based development system introduced for the growth/development of the individuals through continuous quarterly check-ins between the Appraiser and the Appraisee on the basis of predefined and agreed set of expectations.

### Who can be placed under Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)?

All full time/part time employees at Leapfrog including fixed term, probation, and permanent employees are within the scope of being placed in Performance Improvement Plan.

### How does feedback work in Pulse?

Feedback in Pulse is given by the Appraiser on the Appraisee's achievements, updates, or tasks. The Appraisee can reply or comment, and the conversation continues. Feedback can be given at any point during the quarter, at the end of a project, or during project transfer. The goal is to have more feedback loops for continuous assessment.

### What happens if expectations set in Pulse are not met?

If expectations set in Pulse are not met, the Appraiser may place the Appraisee under a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) for closer observation and support to help them meet the required expectations.

### How is quarterly feedback used in the annual performance evaluation?

The summary feedback of all quarters recorded in Pulse is used during the Annual Performance Evaluation. This removes the need to revisit every feedback given throughout the year, as the summary is auto-reflected for the final evaluation.
