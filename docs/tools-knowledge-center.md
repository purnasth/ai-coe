## Knowledge Center

### AI Center of Excellence (CoE)

AI Centre of Excellence (CoE) is a group dedicated to enhancing internal productivity, accelerating innovation, and establishing Leapfrog as an AI-first AWS partner. The CoE aims to:

- Enable higher-margin AI engagements
- Build stronger AWS AI partnerships and co-selling opportunities
- Create reusable AI assets to reduce time-to-market
- Scale AI workforce expertise

By structuring AI efforts, Leapfrog can capture more AI deals, increase efficiency, and create long-term differentiation in AI services. Without an AI CoE, Leapfrog risks being seen as a software company that does AI, rather than an AI-first company.

### AI R&D

The AI R&D Team explores the frontiers of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) through research and development of Proof of Concepts (PoCs). These PoCs are used to showcase technological expertise and insights to potential clients.

**Vision:**

- Explore AI/ML through research and PoCs
- Build a curated slide deck to demonstrate technical prowess and real-world applications
- Engage clients and establish thought leadership

**Slack Channels:** #poc-llm-chatbot, #poc-llm-team

**Account Manager:** @Rajiya Rijal
**Technical Advisors:** @Chris Bohnert, @Ayush Shrestha

**Core Team:**
| Name | Role | Email |
|--------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| Erica Joshi | Project Manager | ericajoshi@lftechnology.com |
| Amit Joshi | Team Lead | amitjoshi@lftechnology.com |
| TBD | AI Expert | TBD |
