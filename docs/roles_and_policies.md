## Understanding Trajectories

- Step-ups to higher levels are not assured on a half yearly or yearly basis by default.
- Consistent above average or exceptional performance can help candidates jump one level or skip the last level before promotion to Senior designations.
- For candidates with a history of average and below average performance, step-up to higher levels will take longer than half-yearly or yearly intervals.

## Expectations during Recruitment

All hiring managers, interviewers, recruiters and positions involved in planning of recruitment must be clear in their understanding of the levels described in this document. Recommendations for candidates for ‘Software Engineer’ and ‘Designer’ must have corresponding levels included.
