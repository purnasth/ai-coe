# Growth Assessment Program (GAP)

## Introduction

Leapfrog Technology introduces the Growth Assessment Program (GAP), developed by the The Architect Team (DART). GAP is a strategic framework designed to enhance the evaluation and development of engineering personnel, particularly targeting senior positions such as Senior Software Engineers (SSE), Lead Engineers (LEs), and Principal Engineers (PEs). This program is part of our commitment to fostering a culture of leadership, innovation, and technical excellence within our organization.

## Objectives of GAP

GAP aims to address two key areas:

- **Career Growth Guidance:** Assisting senior engineers in navigating their career advancement effectively.
- **Simplified Assessment:** Streamlining the evaluation process through structured and timely documentation of achievements.

## Framework and Implementation

To implement GAP, the DART team has appointed mediators based on their demonstrated leadership within various company sectors. These mediators are integral to guiding participants through the assessment process.

### For Leapfroggers Enrolled in GAP

Participants are expected to engage actively with their mediators and follow a clear set of steps:

1. **Initiate Dialogue:** Inform your mediator of your readiness to advance.
2. **Review Competency Matrix:** Understand the skills and competencies required, as outlined in DART’s competency matrix document.
3. **Document Accomplishments:** Record your achievements over the past year in any format (e.g., slides, Google Docs). These can include contributions outside your current project and plans for future initiatives.
4. **Review and Present:** After preparing your documentation, have it reviewed by your mediator. Once finalized, notify architects@lftechnology.com to schedule a presentation of your accomplishments.

## Empowerment and Expectations

With the motto "Power to you", GAP emphasizes self-initiative and personal responsibility in shaping one’s career trajectory. Participants are encouraged to set their own goals, choose the format for their documentation, and decide on the timing of their evaluations. This approach is intended to cultivate leadership qualities by encouraging engineers to take charge of their growth without relying on direct supervision.

## Conclusion

GAP is designed to not only improve the fairness and effectiveness of assessments but also align these efforts with Leapfrog Technology’s strategic goals. By empowering our engineers and providing a clear framework for growth and recognition, we aim to sustain a culture that values continuous learning and development.

This document serves as an introduction to the principles, processes, and expectations of the Growth Assessment Program. For more detailed information, participants and mediators should refer to the comprehensive guidelines provided by DART.

# Growth Assessment Program (GAP) Policy

## Introduction

The Growth Assessment Program (GAP) at Leapfrog is a structured initiative designed to facilitate career growth by providing a supportive environment, resources, and opportunities for professional development. GAP helps employees achieve significant career milestones by enhancing their competencies, enabling them to progress to the next career milestone. Even with successful completion of GAP, advancing to the next level/position may require meeting additional milestones.

This program reflects Leapfrog’s commitment to nurturing internal talent and aligns with the company’s broader goals of fostering leadership, innovation, and technical excellence across all levels.

## Purpose of Policy

- **Standardized Evaluation:** Establish a consistent evaluation framework for assessing individual career growth and milestones, promoting fairness and transparency throughout the process.

## Scope

GAP assesses individuals on their ability to drive technical excellence, innovation, and project direction across all levels within Leapfrog. This GAP policy applies to all individuals formally enrolled in [GAP](https://lftechnology.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/LEAP/pages/4336451587) across different levels and areas.

For the purposes of this policy, the term **“Career milestones”** are defined as the key achievements that signify an individual's progress in their career at Leapfrog. These milestones are markers that demonstrate the readiness of an individual to advance to the next level in their professional journey. For example, to advance from Software Engineer to Senior Software Engineer, Individuals might need to hit several milestones, such as meeting required experience, achieving performance goals, and showing competencies through an evaluation like GAP. Passing GAP with positive feedback is one of these milestones.

## Eligibility for Enrollment in GAP

Employees can initiate their participation in the Growth Assessment Program (GAP) at any time. For guidance on competencies and expectations, employees should consult their Team Managers. This proactive approach helps employees prepare and grow professionally, ensuring they are ready for evaluation when selected.

However, formal enrollment and evaluation in GAP of the “selected individual” will only be conducted for those who meet the following criteria:

- **Experience:** Completion of the required years of experience for the relevant career milestones.
- **Competency:** Demonstration of relevant skills and/or meeting competency matrix.
- **Performance:** Exceptional performance in project work.
- **Contributions:** Significant contributions beyond standard project responsibilities.

Please note that these criteria may vary depending on the specific area and level of the individual.

## Definition of Roles

- **Individuals:** Employees who have been finalized and enrolled in GAP are responsible for actively engaging with the program and meeting its criteria.
- **Evaluation Committee:** They can be the Technical Leaders, Team Manager, Engineering Managers or DART, depending on the Individual’s area and role. They initiate and coordinate GAP.
- **Team Manager:** Take responsibility and accountability for the Individual’s career growth through GAP.
- **Mediators:** Intermediaries who facilitate the assessment process, ensuring adherence to standard evaluation procedures and aiding communication between Evaluation Committee and Individuals.
- **Interview Committee:** Selected by Evaluation Committee to assess Individuals' artifacts through presentations.
- **People Management:** Responsible for facilitating GAP, tracking adherence to the process, and ensuring timely and efficient conduct of assessments.

> **Note:** The roles in GAP might vary depending upon the requirement of the area and levels. In addition to the above roles, few of the roles might be added in the area specific GAP procedures.
